Helper tool for rendering  mathematical LaTeX-expressions.

The tool provides the user with a very simplistic gui that renders tex-expressions directly while typing and is able to copy the rendered images to the clipboard without transparency or alternatively saving them to the desktop while maintaining transparency information.

It is licensed under the terms of GPL3 and can be used for annotating pdf-documents in lectures, including formulas in powerpoint or openoffice-presentations and other similar use cases.
